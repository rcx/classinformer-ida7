Class Informer:
===========================================================
IDA Pro class vftable finder, namer, fixer, lister plug-in.
Version 2.6, July 2018
By Sirmabus

http://www.macromonkey.com/bb/index.php/topic,13.0.html

---------------------------------------------------------
Scans MSVC target IDBs for vftables with C++ RTTI data.
Places structures, names, labels, and comments to class vftables
(Virtual Function Table) to aid reverse engineering.
Also further assists by defining and associating known data structures.
Creates a list window for browsing by object name.

RTTI ("Run-Time Type Identification"):
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTTI

It's currently targeted for Microsoft Visual C++ complied binaries only.
Unpredictable results if used on other targets.

-- [Install] --------------------------------------------
Copy the plug-in to your IDA Pro "plugins" directory.
Then edit your "..\plugins\plugins.cfg" to setup with a hotkey.

IE: Add these two lines:
; Sirmabus "Class Informer" plug-in
Class-Informer IDA_ClassInformer_PlugIn.plw Alt-2 0

See IDA documentation for more on installing and using plug-ins.


-- [How to run it] --------------------------------------
Invoke as usual in IDA with an assigned hot key, or through IDA's
"Edit->Plugins" menu.

Dialog Options:
"Place structures": Uncheck this if you don't want RTTI data structures to be
defined and placed; instead individual data elements will be cleaned up and
placed with additional comments.

"Process static initializers & terminators": If unchecked the processing of
static ctor and dtor tables will be skipped.

"Overwrite anterior comments": Check if you want existing anterior (above)
comments be erased and overwritten. Class Informer will place separation and
information comments above vftables, etc.  Default unchecked.

"Audio on completion": Uncheck this if you don't want any audio completion
sound.

On completion a list window will come up showing any found vftables and
relevant class information.
Lines with multiple inheritance that are not the main class will be colored
gray.
Click on a line to jump to it's vftable.


Example list output:
0046769C 077 CEdit:CWnd, CCmdTarget, CObject;  (SI)

This is: vftable address, method count, and class hierarchy ended with some
additional class info.
To make things easier to read, all known type names are considered to be a
"class" unless explicitly proceeded with "struct" to indicate "structure" type.

The addition info at the end:
"(SI)" single inheritance hierarchy, "(MI)" multiple inheritance,
"(VI)" virtual inheritance, or "(MI VI)" multiple virtual inheritance.


-- [Design] ---------------------------------------------

I read Igor Skochinsky's excellent article:
"Reversing Microsoft Visual C++". And ran some his IDC accompanying scripts.
I was amazed at how well it worked on identifying vftables with a gold mine of
type information and how it helped clean up an IDB by defining data structures.

But the scripts had several problems and I wanted to put it into a plug-in
anyhow for speed, flexibility, and to build as a general test bed for class
information and research.

I originally I had in mind some sort of automatic object member naming.
But after doing real world tests I found it wasn't so useful.

For my RE work I really just need to see these classes by name, and then where
to find them for closer examination. Then adding automatic fixing and labeling
of ctor and dtor tables is a bonus.

As of version 2.0 switched to a different RTTI finding/scanning scheme.
No longer scanning and locating vftables first. Now "Complete Object Locator"
are located directly. This leads to more accuracy; less vftables are missed.


-- [Thanks and Appreciation] ----------------------------

To Igor Skochinsky for the RTTI information and inspiration.
To "sh!ft" for the source code to his version, and ideas that lead to the new
improved scanning scheme.
To "jlnsrk" for the reversed 64 bit RTTI version information.
To Chris Eagle for mentioning Class Informer in his book:

Disassembler"


-- [History] --------------------------------------------

2.6 - 1) Updated to IDA SDK 7.1

2.5 - 1) Updated to IDA 7 and MSVC 2017.
         Some of the changes for this:
          Doesn't place types/structs, nor names or comments if they already exist.
          Now the scanning role is more of looking for and fixing things IDA might have missed.
      2) Now catches a rare secondary case where an assumed member function is unresolved bytes to
         increase the accuracy of vftable member count scanning.

2.4 - 1) Now scans all "DATA" type segments. Before would only scan the first
         ".data" and ".rdata" segments.
      2) Added segment select option to plug-in dialog.

2.2 - 1) Updated to IDA SDK 6.9 and MSVC 2015.

2.1 - 1) Removed the "IDA updating, please wait.." wait for IDA to update thing
         at the end of processing to fix an ocassional hang.
          2) Updated to IDA SDK 6.8 version.

2.0 - A complete overhaul of the entire plug-in.
        1) Updated namings to better match that of Microsoft's internals.
        2) Moved custom type creation out of the init() call; now gets created
        only    on the first run and only if the "Place structures" option is
        checked.
        3) Descriptive comments are now placed on C/C++ initializer and
        terminator table start and end points.
        4) The UI is now a custom Qt one with "material design" elements.
        5) Added a 64bit (32bit IDA's "__E64__") version.
        6) The RTCI (rare MS MFC type) support was removed.
        7) Now locates vftables by RTTI "Complete Object Locator" structures
        directly.
        8) Updated to IDA SDK 6.7 version.
        9) No longer has a default hotkey. Set your own using "plugins.cfg".
        10) Updated and improved the static ctor/dtor processing.

1.06 - 1) Added persistent vftable list storage.
       2) Removed the many unnecessary "autoWait()" calls that caused a bit
       of a slow down.
       3) Fixed broken and updated some custom UI elements.
       4) Fixed the multi-segment select feature for the non-QT version and
          added a working setup for the QT version too. For QT, after desired
          segments are selected right click on the list and do "Select"
          followed by the "Okay" button.
       5) Added the ".data" segment to the default data search since vftables
          are often located there (in addition to ".rdata").

1.05 - 1) The problem with the plug-in not being ready on invocation was fixed
          by returning PLUGIN_KEEP on init to stay resident.
       2) The fix in 1.04 didn't quite do it for structure placement problems.
          In particular there remains a run on problem in IDA when marking some
          areas "unknown"; these "do_unknown()" calls have been removed and
          each structure element is individually placed one by one before
          attempting to place the actual assorted structures.

1.04 - 1) Now ensures RTTI type name strings are set.

1.03 - 1) Added check and warning message for invalid start and end addresses
          with "_initterm" type static/global ctor & dtor tables.
          Would cause a negative count run-on condition that could trample over
          a large data area.
       2) UI customizations auto-disabled when using IDA Qt version.
       3) Current IDA view is refreshed on completion to show changes.
       4) Fixed a stall that could result from repeated failed attempts at an
          RTTI type placement. Plus fixed the pattern for these so they could
          be properly placed.

1.02 - 1) Added user code and data segment selector.
          Allows user to select multiple data and code segments instead of the
          default of ".text" and ".rdata" by name.
          For those rare executable targets that have multiple code sections,
          and, or, unpacked executables with mixed segments, etc.
       2) Added config option for verbose output to the debugger channel.
       3) Improved overall processing speed.
       4) Since there can multiple instances of the same class or structure,
          and IDA names must be unique all duplicate names are now serialized.
          More things labeled, and no more "duplicate name" warning spam.
          Note: Effects only label names, commented names are not altered
       5) Updated to IDA SDK 5.5
       6) Added links to Sirmabus IDA plug-ins support forum.

1.01 - 1) No longer pops up an error and exits IDA when an incompatible IDB is
          loaded. Just displays a "not loaded" log message now.
       2) Fixed IDA tab page update issue.
       3) Now built with IDA SDK 5.4, and tested with IDA 5.4.
       4) Fixed incorrect string placement in the RTTI type info struct.
          Now the structures are right which make a cleaner DB.
          This was a major bottleneck that caused the structure placement to be
          about 36x slower, now only about 1x.
       5) Fixed some misspellings.

-- [TODO] -----------------------------------------------
1) Add support for more compilers and platforms.
2) Add distinction for "pre-terminators" and C/C++ _initterm type tables.
3) Fix cases where _initterm() are register calls.
